How to create the Coventry recycling subsite

1. Install the theme

2. Create the navigation structure as follows:

    Blue Bin
    Brown Bin
    Green Bin

3. Create index articles for each of the categories using the text in resources/Coventry_website_copy.doc

4. Add 2 images to each index article from the content_images directory. The title should have use case "title" and the item image should have use case "items"

5. Create an mpa called contact. Add 4 content sections called main, phone, write and visit with sensible content. Attach the recycling roadshows image with use case "title". Publish in the root category

5. Create demo Coventry Press release items in each category. These go to populate the FAQ section. They only need a title and description. They should be sorted in order of release date.

6. Modify the variables in xsl/top_links.xsl to point to the correct categories.
